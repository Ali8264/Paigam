- **WebSocket**: Protocol for enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure user authentication and session management.
- **Redux**: State management library used to handle the application's state.
- **Babel**: JavaScript compiler used to transform modern JavaScript code into a backward-compatible version.
- **Nodemon**: Development tool that automatically restarts the server when code changes.

## Features
